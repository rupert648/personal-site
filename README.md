# Rupert Carr's Personal Site

I built this site using React and styled components.
The purpose of this site was to both expand my portfolio and to further develop my web skills in both React and CSS.

Prior to this website when developing sites I had mainly resorted to using component libraries and or CSS frameworks. Whilst these are fantastic I realised it had caused me to leave some of the core basics of web development lagging behind. This project was therefore to perfect chance to reconcile that and to develop something of my own from scratch.
